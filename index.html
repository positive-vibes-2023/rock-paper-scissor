						Welcome to the online RPS game. You will play against machines
						(computer) and your goal is to save the mankind by winning against
						Computers!
					</p>
					<p>
						The objective is to reach a score of 5 before the computer in order
						to win the game and hence save the Humans !
					</p>
					<h1>Game Rules:</h1>
					<h2>Player Interaction:</h2>
					<p>
						The player selects their move by clicking on buttons representing
						"Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors."
					</p>
					<h2>Computer's Choice:</h2>
					<p>
						After the player makes their selection, the computer randomly
						chooses one of the three options (Rock, Paper, Scissors) as its
						move.
					</p>
					<h2>Determining the Winner:</h2>
					<p>
						The winner of each round is determined by the traditional Rock,
						Paper, Scissors rules:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Rock beats Scissors</li>
						<li>Scissors beats Paper</li>
						<li>Paper beats Rock</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Scoring:</h2>
					<p>
						The winner of each round earns a point, and their score increases by
						one. In the event of a tie, neither the player nor the computer
						receives a point for that round.
					</p>
					<h2>Game Continuation:</h2>
					<p>
						The game continues round by round until one of the players (computer
						or human) reaches a score of 5 points.
					</p>
					<h2>Game Over:</h2>
					<p>
						When one of the players reaches a score of 5, the game ends, and the
						player with 5 points is declared the winner. A message is displayed
						to announce the winner.
